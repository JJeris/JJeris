About me

My name is Johans, but friends call me JJ.

I’m a student at University of Latvia Computer science faculty, where I study computer science.

I’m particularly interested in blockchain technology and the ways that cryptocurrencies work. I’ve spent some time learning specific programming languages and environments, such as Solidity, along side other base programming languages, like C++, Python, JS and others.

I hope to soon add more and more projects, so as to expand my repo and my knowledge of IT.

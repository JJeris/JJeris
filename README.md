# Hi, my name is Justs.
I’m a student at the University of Latvia Computer science faculty, where I study computer science. I'm currently employed at [PhysicalAddons](https://www.physicaladdons.com/psa/) as a ReactJS and Tauri developer, Blender 3D addon programmer using Python and a Software Tester. I've had extensive experience using JavaScript, Rust, Python, Blender as well as performing technical customer support.

I am particularly interested in game development as well as desktop app development, using sustainable technology, like the Rust Language and Tauri framework.
